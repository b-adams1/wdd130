            <h1>Elden Route</h1>
            <p>Welcome to Elden Route! This is a website that lists all the areas you could see along your way to becoming the Elden Lord. These are not necessarily in the order you should complete them in, but moreso the order you might see them in. New and old players alike may take a glance at what is here, and try to truly become the greatest Tarnished to have ever lived!</p>
            <img src="image/elden_ring1_1600.jpg" alt="elden ring game image">
            <p>At the top of the page, each location is seperated into its location on the Elden Ring map (for example, the places in Limgrave are in the Limgrave section). Navigate to wherever you please, and take note of the places you have been and the places you may have missed! A huge thank you to Fromsoft for making the amazing game that is Elden Ring, as well as Team Future Press for making a very comprehensive and understandable book on the game (which much of this information is gathered from, "Elden Ring Official Strategy Guide, Vol. 1: The Lands Between")</p>
