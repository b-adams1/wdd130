      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I’d like to make a website that is effectively a database of where to go and the “proper” order to go in Elden Ring. There is not really an easily accessible option for all this information that is also simply designed. For many players, there is simply too much to keep track of in the game while it hardly tells you how to do it.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>New/not completely knowledgable videogame players who are interested in Elden Ring</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

        Content

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        People will come to this site because they have played or are playing Elden Ring and have, to some extent, a completionist mindset. It could be that they have done it themselves and now they want to get every possible place, or it could be they are new and feeling lost on where to go. Either way, learning more about the game is the reason they are here. 
        <br>
        <br>There are a few questions that people may expect to be answered with this website. The main one is “What do I do and where do I go” in regard to Elden Ring. There are a few other minor questions, like the “order” to places or what areas they should prioritize before others, but the over-arching question is about what and where.
        <br>
        <br>While I am not certain what will end up being the site, I do have some loose ideas for now. The requirement for the assignment is a home page and two other pages. I wanted as many pages as there are areas in Elden Ring, which is a lot higher than two. Basically, I plan to make a home page, a page for the first area, and a page for the second area. I will get these down for the assignment. 
        <br>
        <br>If I have plenty of time before it is due, I will work on other pages for other areas. If I don’t have time, I plan to do it on my own time in the future because I actually am sort of passionate about this site and want to make it, even if it is just me and my friends that use it. 
        <br>
        <br>As far as actual activities that will be that the audience will want to complete, it will be mostly simple. This is, at the core, a database. That being said, the only real activity to do is read. What the user will actually DO is essentially navigate to the appropriate page that they want and then hopefully read the information that they desire. All in all, there is not much for the user to actually do
        <br>
        <br>The things that have to be known in order to use the site are pretty few. The point of the site is to *provide* information, so there is not much that is needed from the user, but what is needed is extremely necessary. This would be the area of the game that they are in. The information will be divided up by area, so if the user wants to know something about a certain place, they need to know what that place is and then simply go to it.
        <br>
        <br>The main reason that the audience will use this site instead of going to other sources is because it will be an extremely simple display of a mass of information. As someone who plays the game myself, I know what is currently out there for information. There is a lot of text, and it is all fairly complicated to read. In addition to that, the user usually has to go down a rabbit hole to understand what exactly they need, resulting in more time spent searching than actually reading the information that they’re searching for. This site will not contain all the intricate items and everything that makes searching complicated. It will simply give a suggestion as to where to go. It will be simple to read and fundamental information.
